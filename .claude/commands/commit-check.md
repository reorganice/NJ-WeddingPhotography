# Commit Check Command

## Always ask before proceeding:
1. **Are there uncommitted changes worth saving?**
2. **Should I commit before adding new dependencies/features?**
3. **Is this a logical checkpoint in development?**

## Commit-worthy changes include:
- Configuration updates
- New files created
- Feature completions
- Major setup steps
- Documentation updates
- Dependency additions

## Use this command by typing: `/project:commit-check`
